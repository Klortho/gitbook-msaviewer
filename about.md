About the Multiple Sequence Alignment Viewer
============================================

The NCBI Multiple Sequence Alignment Viewer (MSA) is a graphical display
for the multiple alignments of nucleotide and protein sequences.

To start using Multiple Sequence Alignment viewer go to the [Multiple
Sequence Alignment Viewer application](/projects/msaviewer/) page.

Application landing page contains links to multiple examples and demo
pages that you can study before aligning data on your own.

We also recommend going through the [Getting Started
tutorial](/tools/msaviewer/tutorial1/).

You will get the information on the main features of Multiple Sequence
Alignment viewer:

-   How to load alignment into viewer
-   How to select sequence
-   How to select new "master" sequence
-   How to select coloration method
-   How to zoom
-   How to navigate (left/right) along sequence

The Multiple Sequence Alignment Viewer on the web and NCBI's Genome
Workbench are based on the same code libraries and developed by the same
team. Researchers looking for more capabilities should check out [Genome
Workbench](/tools/gbench/).

Feel free to contact us using the feedback link at the top right of the
Multiple Sequence Alignment Viewer page. We really appreciate your
feedback.
